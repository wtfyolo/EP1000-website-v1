            website developement
        </h1>  
        <p>
        for web development we used HTML and css
        HTML is served as the backbone of the website 
        declaring the website frameworks,content , images , the website dimensions
        language used and links. 
        </p>
        <p>
            this is what the beginning of every page looks like
            <br>
            &lt !DOCTYPE &gt declares what document this is in this case HTML
            <br>
            &lt html &gt is used to declare the start of the html file
            <br>
            &lt meta char &gt declares the character set used
            <br>
            &lt title &gt gives the website a title
            <br> 
            &lt link rel = "style" href ="style.css" &gt
            declares the css style sheet used that is used 
            to change the website color layout and overall design
            <br>
            &lt header &gt all of these is encased inside the header
            <br>
            &lt nav &gt is a block of code that is used for my navigation bar
            <br>
             &lt body &gt which is used to declare where
            the main body of the website is at
            <br>
            &lt div class = object &gt
            which are all my different class used as by segmenting into classes
            i can better Manipulate specific groups into different styles in css
            <br>
            &lt h1 &gt is delcared as a header in the body the smaller the number
            will mean a smaller sub header for example  &lt h2 &gt will be a smaller sized
            different header
            <br>
            &lt p &gt is used to represent paragraphs these do not have numbers
            meaning they are all the same 

        </p>
        <h2>
            CSS
        </h2>
        <p>
            CSS is used for editing website layouts and styles like fonts,
            positioning of text , colours and can be used internally or externally
         </p>
        <p>
        for css each of the section has a declare a  
        object {
            insert code here
        }
        and parathesis that is the body of the data is where the code in 
        <br><br>
        <br>
        color: (insert color) ; is used to declare text color 
        background color: (insert color); 
        is used to declare what what background color is used
        <br><br>

        font-family :(family name); is usedto declare font family types like helvetica
        font-weight : (value); is used to declare thickness of the font;
        font-size : (value); is used to declare size of font usually in the form of px or wordsize like LARGE;
        <br><br>
        positioning
        there are multiple ways to position text items and images
        personally i use position : relative; change position relative to original location
        and left : (value); move how much left by pixels , percentages relative to the body size
        top : (value); move how much from the top relative to size
        <br><br>
        <br>
        text-align: (location); is used to align text either center left or right;
        <br><br>
        width : (value); is used to declare size of an object width
        height; (value); is used to declare size of an object in height
        <br><br>
        border:1px; used to declare border size
        border-color: aliceblue; used to declare border color
        border:solid; used to declare border type like solid or dashed lines

    <div class = 'cad_block'>
        <h1 id ='CAD'>
            computer graphics and computer aided drafting
        </h1>
        <p>
            for 2d graphics we used 2 different software 
            raster graphics and vector graphics   
        </p>
        <h2>
        Gimp
        </h2>
        <p>
        the first being raster graphics which allows you to edit raster files
        which are pixel based arranged in a matrix to be form images
        files include in the form of Jpeg , Png, GIF.
        for the exercise we used GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
        to edit the image by using the free select tool 
        then adding a mask layer and turning it invisible to get a image of just the object we want.
        </p>
        <h2>Inkscape</h2>
        <p>
         next was vector graphics which uses mathmatical equations to draw out graphics
        the resultant image is often scaleable without losing quality or looking pixelated unlike raster based graphics
        files include SVG,Pdf,EPS,Dvg.
        </p>
        <h2>Fusion 360</h2>
        <p>for 3d cad drafting we used Fusion 360 a 
            3d cad software that uses parametric modelling techniques 
            defined by user dimensions. we can model in 2d to create 2d drawings
            or 3d drawing objects. 
            it uses the form of sketches to create a basic sketch that can be extruded
            using the extrusion tool.
